<h2>You are in Glasgow Central - Very Low Level</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <p>You suddenly emerge through a hole in the wall onto a station platform.</p>
    <p>You realise you are under Glasgow Central but now platform you have ever seen.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>However, it looks like someone has left some kind of message - pinned at eye level where you can't miss it is a subway map .. a rather apocalyptic one.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>As you study the map you wonder whether what looks like graffiti might actually contain a hidden message.</p>
    <p>Examining the map, you notice that some letters have been added and some scored out to give:</p>
    <br/>
    <ul>
      <li>St. Enoch</li>
      <li>Bridge Street (changed to "Braaaiins Street")</li>
      <li>West Street (changed to "Infest Street")</li>
      <li>Shields Road</li>
      <li>Kinning Park (changed to "Killing Park")</li>
      <li>Cessnock (changed to "Cesshock")</li>
      <li>Ibrox (changed to "Diebrox")</li>
      <li>Govan (changed to "Gorevan")</li>
      <li>Partick (changed to "Panick")</li>
      <li>Kevinhall (changed to "Kevinhell")</li>
      <li>Hillhead</li>
      <li>Kelvinbridge</li>
      <li>St. George's Cross</li>
      <li>Cowcaddens (changed to "HowSadEnds")</li>
      <li>Buchanan Street</li>
      <li>Inner Circle (changed to "Dinner Circle")</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <p>Taking the 23 added letters, then removing 9 of the deleted letters, can you rearrange the 14 remaining letters to find the safe subway station?</p>
    <br/>
