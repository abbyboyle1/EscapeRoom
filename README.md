# Escaperoom

This project is an interactive escape room activity designed for teaching various aspects of cyber security.

Designed for students with base level knowledge of cyber and computer systems.

Players are challenged under timed conditions to identify and resolve various cyber threats based in the Glasgow Tower. Players must be cautios as valuable points get deducted for incorrect answers.

## Building the App

Run `ng build` to build the project while in teh base folder. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build. These can then be hosted in your web server.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).


## Development - Getting Started Instructions

Make sure to choose the correct installer for your machine
recommended:

    For Windows: Windows 32-bit Installer: https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.21.3/node-v14.21.3-x86.msi
    For macOs: macOS 64-bit Installer: https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.21.3/node-v14.21.3.pkg
    For Linux: Linux 64-bit Binary: https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.21.3/node-v14.21.3-linux-x64.tar.xz

### 3. Install VS Code from from [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Again make sure to choose the correct installer for your machine

Once downloaded open the app

### 4. Clone the project 

From the VS Code Welcome screen select: clone git repository...

in the input box that appears paste: `git@github.com:GSC-Development/StemFutures.git`

Select the first option that comes up and choose a location to store this (you will need to locate this every time you want to start the project so make sure its somewhere that is easy to find)

Click open if this doesnt happen automatically.

Click Yes I trust authors

### 5. Install dependencies

From the top bar select Terminal then New Terminal from the drop down

In the prompt that comes up at the bottom of the screen: `npm install`

This will install all the dependencies needed for the project

## Running the App in VS Code

Open the project in VS Code (if not already opened)

Open the terminal (see first part of step 5)

Type into the prompt: `npm run start`

Once compiled, navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)

 ## Running the App as a Dev server

 Go to the project directory and launch the server.

`cd my-app`

`ng serve --open`

The `ng serve` command launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files.

Using the `--open` (or just `-o`) option will automatically open your browser on `http://localhost:4200/`.
